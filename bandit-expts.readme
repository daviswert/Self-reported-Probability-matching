bandit experiments

1. 	between-subjects: probabilities = [60,80]
	between-subjects: dominant side = [L,R]
	exp.n_trials = 50;
	max time / trial = 2000ms;
	delay / trial = ...?

2. probabilities: between [60,80]
   dominant side = R
   n_trials = between [50, 100]
   max time / trial = 2000ms;
   delay / trial = ...?
